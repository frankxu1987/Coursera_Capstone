Seattle is Washington Stateâ€™s largest city, with home to a large tech industry with Microsoft and Amazon headquartered in its metropolitan area. As of 2020, it has a total metro area population of 3.4 million (www.macrotrends.net). The total number of personal vehicles in Seattle in the year 2016 hit a new high of nearly 444,000 vehicles. In one South Lake Union census tract, the car population has more than doubled since 2010 (www.seattletimes.com). The increase in car ownership rates can lead to higher numbers of accidents on the road because of a simple probability. Worldwide, approximately 1.35 million people die in road crashes each year, on average 3,700 people lose their lives every day on the roads and an additional 20-50 million suffer non-fatal injuries, often resulting in long-term disabilities.The project aims to predict how severity of accidents can be reduced based on a few factors.

After assessing the data and the output of the Machine Learning models, a few recommendations can be made for the stakeholders. The developmental body for Seattle city can assess how much of these accidents have occurred in a place where road or light conditions were not ideal for that specific area and could launch development projects for those areas where most severe accidents take place in order to minimize the effects of these two factors. Whereas, the car drivers could also use this data to assess when to take extra precautions on the road under the given circumstances of light condition, road condition and weather, in order to avoid a severe accident, if any.
